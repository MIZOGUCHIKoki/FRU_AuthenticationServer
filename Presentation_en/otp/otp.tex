    \begin{block}{What is the One Time Password?}
        \textit{One Time Password} (OTP) is a password that changes each time for authentication on the network.\footfullcite{スーパー大辞林}\\
        Even if the password is stolen during the communication path, it will be invalid for the next access.

    I Adopt \textbf{\color{red} SAS-L(1)}\footnote{Invented by Professor SHIMIZU Akihiro.} which is \textbf{Light} and \textbf{Fast} as OTP protocol ．

    \begin{alertblock}{Mutual authentication\hfill\textbf{\fbox{\scriptsize Solved}}}
        The current SAS-L(1) is
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The server authenticates the client,
            \item BUT the client CANNNOT authenticate the server.
        \end{itemize}
        EAP-MD5 (in which the client doesn't authenticate the server) may allow that
        \textbf{a client access an unauthrized server.}\\
        Authentication protocol used EAP must have the mutual authentication.
    \end{alertblock}
    \begin{alertblock}{Sync Error\hfill\textbf{\fbox{\scriptsize Solved}}}
        It's needed to detect ``Sync Error'' and to restore verifire.
        Verifire must be equal between the server and the client to authenticate.
