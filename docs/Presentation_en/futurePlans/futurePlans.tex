        \begin{itemize}
            \setlength{\itemsep}{1em}
            \item[\cmark] When returning the \texttt{ACK} from the client to the server,
                if the same verifire \(\gamma\) is returned, there is possibility of unauthrized access.
            \item Check to see if it can withstand a replay attack. \\
                  For any combination of verifire, I have to prove inductively that we cannnot compute the necessary verifire for authentication this time.
        \end{itemize}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item[\cmark] Establish the communication sequence.
            \item[\cmark] Design packets.
            \item[\cmark] Check the authentication protocol.
            \item A Research on Cryptography protocols between the swich supported IEEE802.1X and the RADIUS server.
            \item A Research on RADIUS VSA using in PMK delivery.
            \item A Research on how supplicant can make the OS recognize PMK.
        \end{itemize}

    Implementing using Python.\\
    \hfill I aim to complete it by the end of this year!
